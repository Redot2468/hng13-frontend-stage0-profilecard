# âœ¨ Lawal Ridwan's Frontend Profile Card

## Overview
A dynamic and responsive frontend profile card application, developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project serves as a personal showcase, displaying key information, social links, a live time tracker, and an interactive contact form equipped with robust client-side validation.

## Features
-   **User Profile Display**: Presents essential personal details, including a bio, hobbies, and dislikes.
-   **Dynamic Time Tracking**: Displays the current time in milliseconds, updating live on the profile page for a real-time experience.
-   **Social Media Integration**: Provides direct, clickable links to Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles for easy connection.
-   **Interactive Contact Form**: A dedicated contact page (`contactus.html`) features a user-friendly form with comprehensive client-side validation for full name, email, subject, and message length.
-   **About Me Section**: A separate page (`aboutme.html`) offers deeper insights into the developer's bio, goals for HNG, areas targeted for growth, and a reflective note to a future self.
-   **Responsive Design**: Built with foundational CSS principles to ensure a clean and adaptable user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
